## LESSON - 1

- with the help of <script> tag we can load code from anywhere on the internet.

- React is an external library

  - external library is code written by someone else which is not on your computer.
  - React helps making websites easier.

- React (React is available for both mobile and web applications so the react packages inclues all the common features for react for web and react for mobile).

- ReactDom (ReactDom has only web specific features , so while creating websites we only use ReactDom).

- WEBSITE -> (REACT + REACTDOM)
- MOBILE -> (REACT + REACTNATIVE)

- JSX => JAVASCRIPT + XML

  - Javascript with some extra features.
  - Same as Javascript but we can write html directly in our code.

- BABEL

  - BABEL is a javasript transpiler (compiler) user to convert modern javascript code to older versions.
  - In React we use JSX. Browsers don't understand JSX so Babel converts the JSX code to javascript code which browsers can understand.

- How does using react helps building website easier?
  - It feels much natural compared to selecting elements manually with document object.
  - JSX lets us find errors easier.
  - We can inside values inside JSX elements.
