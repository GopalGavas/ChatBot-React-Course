### Components and Props

# Components

- Components are a piece of Website .
- Components let us create our own html element.
- While building a website it is better to break down the website into components so we can work on them individually .
- Good convention is to name the components in PascalCase (ExampleText) .

# Props

- Props allows us to insert values into the components or we can say it is a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component, which makes the components reusable .

# && (Guard Operator):

firstValue && secondValue (if first value is true then the answer is second value)
